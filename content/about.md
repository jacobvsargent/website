## In a paragraph
I try to make peoples' days easier. Whether that's automating the most frustrating part of their workday or cracking bad jokes every so often. I'm not terribly invested in coding, political research, or web design, but I do have experience in all of them. I think my role on teams is connecting needs with abilities. I love to travel, read Wikipedia, play Pokemon, and talk about politics.
