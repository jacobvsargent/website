## In a paragraph
Making peoples' days easier is what I do. Whether that's automating the most frustrating part of your workday or cracking dad jokes every few minutes. I'm not terribly invested in coding, political research, or UX/UI design, but I do have experience in all of them. I think people like having me on teams because I do well in connecting needs with abilities. I love to travel, read Wikipedia, play Pokemon, and talk about politics.
