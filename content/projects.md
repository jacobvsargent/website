## House Rules
House Rules is a project by me and Nick Deas (@nickdeas). The website is based in Django and is pretty ugly (my fault). While totally functional, we're working to make it easier to navigate and not as hideous. However, due to the nature of House Rules, the pandemic has basically nullified its reason to exist, so it'll be a while before we get around to this.

## Bet On It
Bet On It is another project by me and Nick Deas (@nickdeas). The website and app are currently in development, but this is where it will be once it's done.

## Trivia Tournaments
I have put on two trivia tournaments for charity since the pandemic began. Food insecurity has risen by over 50% in my home of Aiken, South Carolina, and with that, the needs of Food Banks has shot up. Here is the Facebook page for the most recent fundraiser, which is on June 18th and supports Golden Harvest Food Bank.
