## Bet On It
**Bet On It** is another project by me and Nick Deas (@nickdeas). The website and app are currently in development, but this is where it will be once it's done.

## Clemson Nights
**Clemson Nights** is a project I'm working on with my sister, Emma. We are working with Clemson's local restaurants and bars to highlight nightly specials on food & drink. The website is almost finished, and we will officially launch once it is safe to eat out again.

## Trivia Tournaments
I have put on two virtual trivia tournaments for charity since the pandemic began. Food insecurity has risen by over 50% in my home of Aiken, South Carolina, and with that, the needs of Food Banks has shot up. Here is the Facebook page for the most recent fundraiser, which was on June 18th and supports Golden Harvest Food Bank. Together, the two tournaments raised over $1,000.

## House Rules
**House Rules** is a project by me and Nick Deas (@nickdeas). The website is based in Django and runs on Google Cloud Platform. While totally functional, we're working to make it easier to navigate and not as hideous. However, the pandemic has basically nullified its reason to exist, so it'll be a while before we get around to this.
