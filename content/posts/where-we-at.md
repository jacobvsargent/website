## Where We're At ##

Website: 80% Complete
	-Functionality: 95%
	-Design: 70%
	-Security: 50%

App: Unsure. Should talk to Nick more about this.

We're so close to having a website that I don't mind telling people to look at. Like right there.

Developing a product like this is a huge chicken-and-egg situation. Like Uber needing drivers, but to attract drivers, it needs riders. On the one hand, showing charities the progress we've made so far is integral to getting them on board. However, we need several charities to join for the website to work and look as intended. It's tough to get the first few. 

I think that BOI can function for a while with just Paw Pantry & Izzie's Pond. The winner-picks-charity aspect of the platform will be really important in the long-run, but for now, we should just focus on getting people to sign up.

Our next major challenges are the app and token-buying. Everything else seems to be falling into place. The 'leap of faith' here is believing that once the platform fits our vision, that people will begin to use it. Here's hoping.
