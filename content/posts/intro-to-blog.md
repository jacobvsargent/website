***Intro to the Blog***

I have never been one to make public statements. As far as publically available information and opinions go, people accept the ones they agree with and distance themselves from difference. 

My purpose in creating this blog is to provide people who already know me with a resevoir of my thoughts, so that they might see how someone they thought believed in something, really believed in something else. 

It's mostly for me though. I'd like to look back over years and remind myself that I am constantly changing my opinions and beliefs, so that it may be easier to do in the future. 

Welcome.
