## Welcome to the Real World ##
### or, "your way of doing things sucks" ###

Family beach trip. 15 people. Pizza night. Got it?

We ordered Papa John's at about 6:30 on a Tuesday. Soon after, storms took the power of our whole house, neighborhood, and apparently every Papa John's within a 10-mile radius. Obviously there would be some sort of delay. 

8:30: no word.

So we called to check in, and they said that a Doordash deliveryman had left the restaurant about 35 minutes prior with our order. Should be there any minute. 

9:15: no pizza.

So I called again, not angrily, but more to let them know that their contract deliveryperson had likely gone rogue. They had. A family member chimed in while I was on the phone that I was being too nice. "You gotta let 'em have it." Whatever. This time, the person on the other end let us know that there was a mix-up with the address, likely due to a recent city-wide rezoning. He was going to call a different Papa John's, closer to us, and that the whole was going to be free.

Sweet. That sounds like the optimal scenario right there. 

10pm. 3 and a half hours post-order. No pizza.

I didn't want to call this time, but I was convinced. 10pm was also closing time, so it was important to call before everyone left the physical Papa John's. I heard a new voice on the other end, the general manager. She told us that they tried contacted the other Papa John's, but they were forced to closed for the day after the storms. They'd never received power again. Thinking they could offload our order, they had already taken ours off their registry.

It was not only reasonable, but also seemed like it would have happened anywhere. A backlog of 70 orders to fulfill would cause issues anywhere, and on top of that we had (unknowingly) provided the wrong address. It was really nobody's fault.

The general manager said they were closing up, but she'd stick around to make our order and hand-deliver it to us. I gave her our address, double-checked this time, and she promised it'd be there as soon as she could get it to us. I said thanks and hung up. Still, I was "too nice". When prompted why it had taken so long, I told the group that she was trying her best. A lot of eye rolls. "Welcome to the real world."

11pm: no word. This was when the atmosphere in the house turned. I had heard from the general manager a promise that she was going to deliver the order when it was ready, and she sounded sincere and exhausted. That wasn't enough. Eventually, voices rose that someone else should call the Papa John's just to yell at them. Just to be "assertive" and "forceful". "Strike the fear of God in them." Not my style. I fended off those attempts for a while, and eventually the angriest of the bunch went to bed.

11:30pm. Tanya, the general manager, pulled into the driveway. She looked like she'd just been through Hell Week yet still put up a cordial smile and handed us the 3 'zas and a cookie cake. I don't know if, without a doubt, she did everything possible to get our order to us at the absolute fastest speed, but I saw a person who was really trying her best. 

I went back upstairs to those who waited and trusted that the pizza was coming. And we feasted. 

Still, the next day, the talk was that it would have been there hours faster if we'd used the "assertive" (read: obnoixious) approach, but I couldn't care less.

In my short time here on Earth, I've noticed there are generally two types of people. Those who have worked in service, and those who are rude to servicepeople.
