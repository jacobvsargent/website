<p>Family beach trip. 15 people. Pizza night. Got it?</p>
<p>We ordered Papa John&rsquo;s at about 6:30 on a Tuesday. Soon after, storms took the power of our whole house, neighborhood, and apparently every Papa John&rsquo;s within a 10-mile radius. Obviously there would be some sort of delay.</p>
<p>8:30: no word.</p>
<p>So we called to check in, and they said that a Doordash deliveryman had left the restaurant about 35 minutes prior with our order. Should be there any minute.</p>
<p>9:15: no pizza.</p>
<p>So I called again, not angrily, but more to let them know that their contract deliveryperson had likely gone rogue. They had. A family member chimed in while I was on the phone that I was being too nice. &ldquo;You gotta let &lsquo;em have it.&rdquo; Whatever. This time, the person on the other end let us know that there was a mix-up with the address, likely due to a recent city-wide rezoning. He was going to call a different Papa John&rsquo;s, closer to us, and that the whole was going to be free.</p>
<p>Sweet. That sounds like the optimal scenario right there.</p>
<p>10pm. 3 and a half hours post-order. No pizza.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to call this time, but I was convinced. 10pm was also closing time, so it was important to call before everyone left the physical Papa John&rsquo;s. I heard a new voice on the other end, the general manager. She told us that they tried contacted the other Papa John&rsquo;s, but they were forced to closed for the day after the storms. They&rsquo;d never received power again. Thinking they could offload our order, they had already taken ours off their registry.</p>
<p>It was not only reasonable, but also seemed like it would have happened anywhere. A backlog of 70 orders to fulfill would cause issues anywhere, and on top of that we had (unknowingly) provided the wrong address. It was really nobody&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>The general manager said they were closing up, but she&rsquo;d stick around to make our order and hand-deliver it to us. I gave her our address, double-checked this time, and she promised it&rsquo;d be there as soon as she could get it to us. I said thanks and hung up. Still, I was &ldquo;too nice&rdquo;. When prompted why it had taken so long, I told the group that she was trying her best. A lot of eye rolls. &ldquo;Welcome to the real world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11pm: no word. This was when the atmosphere in the house turned. I had heard from the general manager a promise that she was going to deliver the order when it was ready, and she sounded sincere and exhausted. That wasn&rsquo;t enough. Eventually, voices rose that someone else should call the Papa John&rsquo;s just to yell at them. Just to be &ldquo;assertive&rdquo; and &ldquo;forceful&rdquo;. &ldquo;Strike the fear of God in them.&rdquo; Not my style. I fended off those attempts for a while, and eventually the angriest of the bunch went to bed.</p>
<p>11:30pm. Tanya, the general manager, pulled into the driveway. She looked like she&rsquo;d just been through Hell Week yet still put up a cordial smile and handed us the 3 &lsquo;zas and a cookie cake. I don&rsquo;t know if, without a doubt, she did everything possible to get our order to us at the absolute fastest speed, but I saw a person who was really trying her best.</p>
<p>I went back upstairs to those who waited and trusted that the pizza was coming. And we feasted.</p>
<p>Still, the next day, the talk was that it would have been there hours faster if we&rsquo;d used the &ldquo;assertive&rdquo; (read: obnoixious) approach, but I couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>
<p>In my short time here on Earth, I&rsquo;ve noticed there are generally two types of people. Those who have worked in service, and those who are rude to servicepeople.</p>
