      <description>Closed on Sundays A Love Letter to Chick-Fil-A When you think about Chick-Fil-A, what comes to mind?
For some, it&amp;rsquo;s service, hospitality, and a really good, if not kind of expensive chicken sandwich.

      <description>Intro to the Blog
I have never been one to make public statements. As far as publically available information and opinions go, people accept the ones they agree with and distance themselves from difference.
My purpose in creating this blog is to provide people who already know me with a resevoir of my thoughts, so that they might see how someone they thought believed in something, really believed in something else.</description>
